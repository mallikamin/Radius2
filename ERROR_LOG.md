## CRITICAL — Recurring Container Errors (READ FIRST)

These errors come up repeatedly across agents. If you hit any of them, the fix is documented — don't waste time debugging.

### RECURRING-1 — Vite proxy ECONNREFUSED to API on container startup

- **Error**: `[vite] http proxy error: /api/... Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 172.30.0.3:8000`
- **Context**: Local dev — `orbit_dev_web` starts before `orbit_dev_api` is healthy
- **Root Cause**: `docker-compose.yml` web service has `depends_on: - api` but does NOT use `condition: service_healthy`. The API takes 10-30s to boot (uvicorn + DB connection), but Vite starts instantly and begins proxying to a not-yet-ready API.
- **Fix**: This is **expected on cold start** — it self-resolves once the API is healthy (~30s). NOT a real error.
- **Rule**: Ignore ECONNREFUSED errors in `orbit_dev_web` logs during the first 30s after `docker compose up`. If they persist beyond 60s, check if the API container is healthy: `docker inspect orbit_dev_api --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}'`

### RECURRING-2 — Frontend changes not visible after edit (HMR miss on Windows)

- **Error**: Code changes saved to `frontend/src/App.jsx` but browser shows old version
- **Context**: Local dev on Windows — Vite HMR doesn't fire because Windows→Linux bind mounts don't always trigger inotify events
- **Root Cause**: Docker bind mount from Windows NTFS to Linux ext4 inside container — filesystem events don't propagate reliably
- **Fix**: `docker restart orbit_dev_web` → wait 5s → hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- **Rule**: **EVERY TIME** you edit frontend files, restart the web container before telling the user to test. Never say "changes are ready" without doing this first.

### RECURRING-3 — Backend code changes ignored after edit (no --reload)

- **Error**: Edited `backend/app/main.py` on host but API still serves old logic
- **Context**: Local dev `orbit_dev_api` uses `--workers 2` (no `--reload` flag). Production API Dockerfile uses `COPY . .` — container has its own copy.
- **Root Cause**: Local dev bind-mounts `./backend/app:/app/app` so changes ARE visible inside the container, BUT uvicorn with `--workers 2` and no `--reload` flag does NOT watch for file changes.
- **Fix**:
  - **Local dev**: `docker restart orbit_dev_api` (bind mount means no rebuild needed)
  - **Production/DO**: `docker compose up -d --build orbit_api` (must rebuild — Dockerfile uses COPY)
  - **Office server**: `docker compose up -d --build` in `C:\Docker\SitaraCRM`
- **Rule**: After backend edits: local = restart, production = rebuild. `restart` alone on production does NOT work.

### RECURRING-4 — New pip/npm dependency not found in container

- **Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xxx'` or `Cannot find module 'xxx'`
- **Context**: Agent adds a new dependency to `requirements.txt` or `package.json`, but doesn't rebuild the container image
- **Root Cause**: Dependencies are installed at image build time (`RUN pip install` / `RUN npm install`). Editing the requirements file on host doesn't install anything inside the running container.
- **Fix**: Rebuild the affected container: `docker compose up -d --build api` or `docker compose up -d --build web`
- **Rule**: Any change to `requirements.txt` or `package.json` requires `--build` flag on next `docker compose up`.

### RECURRING-5 — API container exits with import error on startup

- **Error**: `orbit_dev_api` or `orbit_api` exits immediately after start, logs show Python ImportError or SyntaxError
- **Context**: Agent edited `main.py` with a syntax error, missing import, or circular import
- **Root Cause**: Uvicorn tries to import `app.main:app` at startup — any import-time error kills the process
- **Fix**: Check logs: `docker logs orbit_dev_api --tail=50`. Fix the Python error. Then restart: `docker restart orbit_dev_api`
- **Rule**: Before restarting API after edits, validate syntax: `python -m py_compile backend/app/main.py`. For services: `python -m py_compile backend/app/services/task_service.py` etc. This catches 90% of startup crashes.

### RECURRING-6 — Frontend container build fails on large App.jsx

- **Error**: `orbit_dev_web` fails to start or Vite crashes with out-of-memory
- **Context**: `App.jsx` is 8000+ lines. Vite dev server can struggle with very large single files
- **Root Cause**: Memory limit in Docker container for Node.js
- **Fix**: If Vite crashes with OOM, increase memory limit or restart Docker Desktop. Usually a simple `docker restart orbit_dev_web` fixes transient crashes.
- **Rule**: Monitor `docker logs orbit_dev_web` after restart. If Vite repeatedly fails, check Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Memory (should be ≥4GB).

## CRITICAL — Deployment Errors

### RECURRING-7 — Stale JS chunks after frontend deploy to DO/Office

- **Error**: Browser loads old JavaScript, shows stale UI or 404 on JS chunk files
- **Context**: SCP'd new `dist/` to server but old files remain (SCP merges, doesn't clean)
- **Root Cause**: `index.html` references `index-NEWHASH.js` but old `index-OLDHASH.js` still exists. Some CDN/browser caching may serve stale `index.html`.
- **Fix**: **Always clean dist before uploading**:
  ```bash
  ssh root@159.65.158.26 "rm -rf ~/orbit-crm/frontend/dist/*"
  ```
  Then SCP fresh dist. Then restart nginx.
- **Rule**: NEVER SCP dist without cleaning first. This is step 2 in the deploy playbook — don't skip it.

### RECURRING-8 — DO site goes dark after container rebuild (POS network disconnect)

- **Error**: `https://orbit-voice.duckdns.org/` returns connection reset / silent drop (HTTP 444)
- **Context**: Ran `docker compose up -d --build orbit_api` on DO server
- **Root Cause**: Container rebuild removes runtime network attachments. Orbit containers lose `pos-system_default` membership. POS nginx can't reach them anymore.
- **Fix**: Reconnect after EVERY rebuild:
  ```bash
  docker network connect pos-system_default orbit_web
  docker network connect pos-system_default orbit_api
  docker exec pos-system-nginx-1 nginx -s reload
  ```
- **Rule**: This must happen AFTER rebuild completes (not in parallel). See `DIGITALOCEAN_DEPLOY_PLAYBOOK.md` step 7.

### RECURRING-9 — Network reconnect run too early (race condition)

- **Error**: Network connect succeeds but site still down after deploy
- **Context**: Agent ran `docker network connect` while `docker compose up --build` was still running
- **Root Cause**: The build step recreates the container — any network connect done before recreation is lost
- **Fix**: Wait for rebuild to complete, THEN connect. Verify with:
  ```bash
  docker inspect orbit_api -f '{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}' | python3 -m json.tool
  ```
  Must include `pos-system_default`.
- **Rule**: Deploy is strictly sequential: rebuild → wait → connect → reload nginx → verify.

## Historical Errors

### HISTORICAL — Docker volume name change causes silent total data loss
- **Error**: All CRM data disappeared after `docker compose up`
- **Context**: Changing docker-compose.yml volume names or removing `external: true`
- **Root Cause**: Docker volume names are immutable. Changing the name silently creates a new empty volume.
- **Fix**: Restored from backup. Volume config locked in CLAUDE.md.
- **Rule**: NEVER change volume `name:` or remove `external: true`. Dev: `radius2_sitara_v3_postgres`. Prod: `sitara_postgres_data`.

### HISTORICAL — Task type casing mismatch
- **Error**: Tasks not appearing when filtered by type
- **Context**: Legacy tasks had uppercase values, filters expected lowercase
- **Root Cause**: No normalization at write or read time
- **Fix**: One-time normalization + case-insensitive filtering + lowercase on create
- **Rule**: Normalize enum-like string fields to lowercase at write time. Case-insensitive comparison at read time.

### HISTORICAL — Host filesystem != container filesystem
- **Error**: File exists on host but container build fails
- **Context**: File created after container was built, or bind mount gap
- **Root Cause**: Agent verified on host, not inside container
- **Fix**: Always verify inside container: `docker compose exec <service> ls <path>`
- **Rule**: Container is source of truth. Check `docker compose logs --tail=20` for build errors.

### 2026-02-17 — Interaction timestamp missing time component
- **Error**: Interaction list shows date-only instead of date+time
- **Context**: API list/details/report outputs for interactions
- **Root Cause**: `Interaction.created_at` uses `server_default=func.now()` which includes time, but frontend display may truncate
- **Fix**: Verified backend sends full datetime. Frontend display format was the issue.
- **Rule**: Always check both backend response shape AND frontend display formatting when datetime appears wrong.

### 2026-02-19 — Deploy race: network reconnect lost after API rebuild
- **Error**: Orbit frontend looked up, but API path could fail after deploy.
- **Context**: `docker network connect pos-system_default orbit_api` was run before `docker compose up -d --build orbit_api` fully finished.
- **Root Cause**: API container was recreated after connect, so runtime-only network attach was lost.
- **Fix**: Re-ran network connect after rebuild completed, then reloaded POS nginx.
- **Rule**: Deploy must be serialized: rebuild API -> connect networks -> reload nginx -> verify network membership.

### 2026-02-19 — Windows SCP path/wildcard pitfalls on manual deploy
- **Error**: SCP failed when using wildcard paths and missing remote directories.
- **Context**: Uploading frontend dist and migration SQL from Windows.
- **Root Cause**: Shell/path expansion differences plus missing `~/orbit-crm/backend/migrations` directory on server.
- **Fix**: Use `scp -r frontend/dist/. root@...:~/orbit-crm/frontend/dist/` and create remote dirs with `mkdir -p` before copy.
- **Rule**: Avoid wildcard-dependent SCP on Windows and always ensure remote path exists first.

### 2026-02-20 — Codex Phase 2 reported missing sales-kpis endpoint (500)
- **Error**: `GET /api/dashboard/sales-kpis` returned 500 Internal Server Error
- **Context**: Phase 6 QA — Codex smoke testing newly added endpoints
- **Root Cause**: Endpoint referenced `Transaction.sales_rep_id` which doesn't exist — correct field is `Transaction.company_rep_id`
- **Fix**: Codex hotfix replaced `sales_rep_id` with `company_rep_id`, restarted API
- **Rule**: When writing queries on models, verify column names against the model class, not assumptions. `Transaction` model uses `company_rep_id` not `sales_rep_id`.

### 2026-02-21 — Receipts not showing in customer reports after data migration
- **Error**: Customer report "Receipts Summary" section empty despite "Total Received" showing correct value
- **Context**: Sitara Square data migration set `installments.amount_paid` but did not create Receipt records
- **Root Cause**: Report has two data sources: `total_received` from `SUM(installments.amount_paid)`, but `receipts` section queries the `receipts` table directly. Migration only updated installments.
- **Fix**: Created `sitara_square_receipts_sync.sql` — generates Receipt + ReceiptAllocation records matching installment payments
- **Rule**: When importing historical payment data, ALWAYS create both installment `amount_paid` AND corresponding Receipt + ReceiptAllocation records. These must stay in sync.

## Quick Reference: Pre-Flight Checks

### Before editing backend code:
```bash
# After edits, validate syntax:
python -m py_compile backend/app/main.py
# Restart (local):
docker restart orbit_dev_api
```

### Before editing frontend code:
```bash
# After edits, restart web container (HMR unreliable on Windows):
docker restart orbit_dev_web
# Wait 5s, then tell user to Ctrl+Shift+R
```

### Before deploying to DO:
1. Clean dist: `ssh root@159.65.158.26 "rm -rf ~/orbit-crm/frontend/dist/*"`
2. SCP files (specific files, not wildcards)
3. Rebuild API: `docker compose up -d --build orbit_api`
4. WAIT for rebuild to complete
5. Reconnect networks: `docker network connect pos-system_default orbit_web && docker network connect pos-system_default orbit_api`
6. Reload nginx: `docker exec pos-system-nginx-1 nginx -s reload`
7. Verify: `docker network inspect pos-system_default --format '{{range .Containers}}{{.Name}} {{end}}'`

### Before DB migrations:
1. Create test DB first (see HANDOFF_NOTES.md Section 2)
2. Run migration on test, validate
3. Only then run on production
4. Drop test DB after

### 2026-02-25 � EOI create endpoint failed on non-UUID project/customer/broker refs
- **Error**: `EOI create error: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "PRJ-0999"`
- **Context**: Smoke test using business IDs like `PRJ-0999`, `CUST-0001`, `INV-99901`
- **Root Cause**: EOI resolver helpers compared UUID columns directly against non-UUID business keys in OR filters, forcing invalid casts in PostgreSQL.
- **Fix**: Added UUID-safe resolvers (`_resolve_eoi_project/_broker/_customer/_inventory`, `_resolve_eoi_record`) using parse-first fallback logic.
- **Rule**: Never OR-compare UUID columns with string business IDs directly; use UUID parsing fallback or helper like `find_entity`.

### 2026-02-25 � Media upload 500 for `uploaded_by_rep_id=REP-0001`
- **Error**: `/api/media/upload` returned 500 with `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "REP-0001"`
- **Context**: EOI attachment upload during smoke test
- **Root Cause**: Uploader lookup queried `(CompanyRep.id == uploaded_by_rep_id) | (CompanyRep.rep_id == uploaded_by_rep_id)` where first predicate attempted UUID cast of rep code.
- **Fix**: Switched uploader lookup to UUID-safe helper `find_entity(db, CompanyRep, "rep_id", uploaded_by_rep_id)`.
- **Rule**: For mixed UUID/business-key inputs, always use UUID-safe entity resolver helpers in upload/action endpoints.

### 2026-02-25 � Receipts list filter failed when transaction_id passed as TXN code
- **Error**: `/api/receipts?transaction_id=TXN-...` returned empty due hidden UUID cast failure path.
- **Context**: Smoke verification after EOI conversion.
- **Root Cause**: Query compared `Transaction.id` UUID directly with string code in OR clause.
- **Fix**: Switched transaction lookup in receipts list to UUID-safe helper `find_entity(db, Transaction, "transaction_id", transaction_id)`.
- **Rule**: Use UUID-safe entity resolvers for all query filters that accept business IDs.
